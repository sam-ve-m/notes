## 2.3.1 Preparing to annotate

In most reading reasons is, there is a reader's thesis that need to be kept in mind during the whole activity. It iss kind off a bias, which is not good in general, but in this situation it optmizes the analisys if one is available to change their mind in the process.

## 2.3.2 Annotation strategies

**Noting for gist**: very basic, is to keep taking notes while reading; remembering to write down only the content's gist (main ideias) in one owns ideias. A good tip is to have one "gist note" per paragraph.
**Record the reader personal *response* to the text**: It doesn't have to be a lengthy answer, but also that express one unique reaction. It would be funny to find these notes in the future too, though.
